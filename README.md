# SYNC-Task-3
This is a very well known statistical project based on Machine Learning. Boston House Price Prediction Project predicts house prices based on various parameters like area, number of rooms, age, and more. It analyzes the various machine learning algorithms to check which algorithm best predicts the house price based on the provided parameters.
Steps - First download the dataset that will be used for prediction. Here I have used boston house prediction dataset. You can download any other dataset as well according to your preference.
Install the libraries required - pandas , numpy , sklearn , matplotlib and pandas vis pip.
Import the dataset and initialize the dataframe
Start training the model by using various algorithms of machine learning.
At the end analyze the prediction algorithm and decide which algorithm best predicts the output.
