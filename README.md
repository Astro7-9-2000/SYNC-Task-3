# SYNC-Task-3
<ul>
<li>This is a very well known statistical project based on Machine Learning.</li> <li>Boston House Price Prediction Project predicts house prices based on various parameters like area, number of rooms, age, and more.</li><li> It analyzes the various machine learning algorithms to check which algorithm best predicts the house price based on the provided parameters.</li>
<b>Steps</b> - <br> 
<li>First download the dataset that will be used for prediction. Here I have used boston house prediction dataset. You can download any other dataset as well according to your preference.</li>
<li>Install the libraries required - pandas , numpy , sklearn , matplotlib and pandas vis pip.</li>
<li>Import the dataset and initialize the dataframe.</li>
<li>Start training the model by using various algorithms of machine learning.</li>
<li>At the end analyze the prediction algorithm and decide which algorithm best predicts the output.</li>
</ul>
